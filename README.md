## Online Version (Under Development)
Follow the link: [IM2 WebApp](http://italogsfernandes.com/imagens-medicas-2)

## Summary

The project [IM2_app](https://github.com/italogsfernandes/imagens-medicas-2) is an initiative to create an open source medical imaging system.

**Obs**:
> The first IM2_app app was developed in MATLAB, this generates contradictions regarding the open-source initiative, however the program must run with all its functionality in Octave.

> There is also a version developed in python, whose app has almost all the features of the MATLAB version, and a few more (eg count the number of colonies).

> A Third version, as a web application is under development and will be released no later than September.

## Instalations
* **MATLAB version**: IM2_app is in its version 1.1.0. Run __*Apps/mIM2_app*__ to use the interface app or __*toolbox/matlab*__ to see its image processing functions.
* **Python version**: Run `python im2_app.py`, located in the folder __*Apps/pyIM2_app*__.
* **Web version**: Visit our web page after the release of this version.
